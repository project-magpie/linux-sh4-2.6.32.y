          Instruction-Based Sampling (IBS) is a new profiling
          technique that provides rich, precise program performance
          information. IBS is introduced by AMD Family10h processors
          (AMD Opteron Quad-Core processor "Barcelona") to overcome
          the limitations of conventional performance counter
          sampling.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_OPROFILE
